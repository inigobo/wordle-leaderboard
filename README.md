# Wordle Tracker

## About the project
This is the final project for the bootcamp in React with [GeeksHub](https://geekshubs.com/) as part of the Tech Academy program at [New Work](https://www.new-work.se/en).

The project aims to create a tracker for the famous word game [`Wordle`](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). The motivation for this project comes from playing this game with my family every day. We share our daily score in a WhatsApp group but have no easy way of keeping track of past games, accumulated score and overall leaderboard.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the `json-server` backend with `yarn server`.
4. Start the app with `npm start`.

## Using the app
The current state of the project is a MVP with mocked data of users and past games. Current features include:

- User registration and login with validated forms.
- User logout.
- User leaderboard for each day ordered by attempts.
- Filter leaderboard by name search or play ID for each day.
- Profile detail view of user information and selected day's game board.
- Profile info modification.

### `Home` page
This is the welcome landing page. Here you can see a welcome message and a carousel with GIFs as hints for today's Wordle word.

### `Leaderboard` page
Here you can see the leaderboard for the current day's plays. You can filter the list using the search bar by usernames and the dropdown menu to select the ID for the day shown.

### `Profile` page
You can navigate to the profile of each user by clicking on the cards in the leaderboard.

The user information is shown as well as the game board for the selected ID play. Also, if the profile is your own, a button to modify your profile is shown. By clicking this, a modal with a form with your data is shown.

### `Login` page
Accessible through the `Login` button in the right-side of the navigation bar. Lets you login to your account or navigate to `Register` if you don't have an account.

### `Register` page
Accessible through the login page. Includes validation and an avatar selector.

### `Add board` modal
Currently the functionality is disabled. Here you paste your game board and updates the database, it automatically retrieves the current user and current day's play ID.

### `Modify profile` modal
Available through the user profile and only if user is self. Automatically retrieves the users data and shows it in the control boxes, values can be modified and are also validated as in the `Register` page.

## Consumed endpoints
This app makes use of a bunch of endpoints:
- General app management (user and plays) uses a fake backend implemented with [`json-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).
- Generation of avatars uses [DiceBear `pixel-art` style](https://dicebear.com/styles/pixel-art).
- Landing page carousel hint GIFs are retrieved from [GIPHY](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide) using today's Wordle word as a keyword.

## Known limitations and future development

Due to the major drawbacks a fake backend brings these limitations have been identified:
- Adding a new game board involves processing the default text generated by the Wordle webpage and saving it to fit the format.
- User groups require a more powerful backend.
- Admin page development. At the moment admin tasks are done directly on the `db.json` of the server.
- Proper automated E2E testing and unit testing.
- Deployment of the application for real life use.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
